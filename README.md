Welcome to **Perchance Revival**! This is a user-friendly Gradio web application designed to bring back the experience of the old Perchance image generator by featuring the specific Stable Diffusion 1.5 models and common generation parameters/presets it used.

Generate images effortlessly and for free, directly on your own PC. This version is designed to **prioritize and utilize your NVIDIA GPU** for significantly faster generation if you have one, while still offering a CPU option for broader compatibility. The goal is to make local SD 1.5 generation as simple as possible, especially for those familiar with the old Perchance site.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Notice**  
> This app is still in **very early development** ‚Äì as in, *started today* early. It can already generate images successfully, but expect bugs, missing polish, and future changes (including some big ones). It‚Äôs functional but **not production-ready yet**. Stability is good so far, but this is more of a preview than a final release.

This project is primarily designed for **Windows** users, offering a straightforward setup with easy-to-use batch files. Manual setup options are also provided for other platforms or advanced users.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Focused on Perchance SD 1.5 Models & Presets:** Access the models and common generation parameters/presets popular on the old Perchance site directly within the app for a nostalgic experience. These models are downloaded and cached automatically from the Hugging Face Hub on first use.
*   **Add Your Own Models:** Easily load *additional* Stable Diffusion 1.5 models (in `diffusers` format) from a local `./checkpoints` folder, alongside the featured Perchance models.
*   **GPU Accelerated (Recommended) or CPU:**
    *   Default setup **attempts GPU installation** for faster generation (requires compatible NVIDIA GPU and drivers).
    *   Automatically falls back to CPU if GPU setup fails, or allows manual CPU-only installation (generation is much slower on CPU).
*   **Comprehensive Generation Controls:**
    *   **Positive & Negative Prompts:** Tell the AI what to include and what to avoid.
    *   **Inference Steps:** Control the detail level (more steps = often more detail, but slower).
    *   **CFG Scale:** Adjust how closely the image follows your prompt (higher = stricter adherence).
    *   **Schedulers:** Experiment with different sampling methods (Euler, DPM++ 2M, DDPM, LMS).
    *   **Image Sizes:** Standard SD1.5 resolutions, plus a "hire.fix" option (interpreted as 1024x1024).
    *   **Seed Control:** Get reproducible results with a specific seed, or use -1 for random.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   Clean and intuitive Gradio UI.
    *   Organized controls with advanced settings in an accordion.
    *   Direct image display with convenient download and share options.
*   **Safety First (Note):** The built-in safety checker is **disabled** in this version to match the flexibility of the old Perchance generator. Please be mindful of the content you generate.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

*   **Windows Operating System:** The provided batch files (`.bat`) are for Windows. For other operating systems, follow the manual setup steps below.
*   **Python:** 3.8 or higher. Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH. Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
*   **Git:** (Required for manual setup and updating) For cloning the repository.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   A modern CPU is required.
    *   For the default GPU setup to succeed: A compatible **NVIDIA GPU** with up-to-date drivers installed. At least 6-8GB VRAM is recommended for 512x512, more for larger sizes or multiple images.
*   **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading models from Hugging Face Hub and for updates.

## üì¶ Easy Setup (Windows - Download & Run)

This is the recommended and easiest method for most Windows users.

1.  **Download the project:**
    *   Go to the GitHub repository page: `https://github.com/Raxephion/Old-Perchance-Revival-WebUI`
    *   Click the green "<> Code" button.
    *   Click "Download ZIP".
2.  **Extract the ZIP:** Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer (e.g., your Documents folder or Desktop). This will create a folder like `Old-Perchance-Revival-WebUI-main` (or similar). You can rename it if you prefer, for example, to `PerchanceRevival`.
3.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    *   Navigate into the extracted folder (e.g., `PerchanceRevival`).
    *   Find the file named `setup.bat`.
    *   **Double-click `setup.bat`** to run it.
    *   A command prompt window will open. Follow the instructions in the window. This script will create a Python virtual environment (`venv`), install all necessary core dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and **attempt to install the GPU-accelerated version of PyTorch (CUDA) by default**.
    *   **‚ùó IMPORTANT:** Read the output in the command prompt carefully during and after the script finishes.
        *   If the GPU installation **succeeds**, the output will confirm this. You are ready to run the app.
        *   If the GPU installation **fails** (e.g., no compatible NVIDIA GPU, incorrect drivers, or internet issues), the script will print specific error messages and **instructions on how to manually install the CPU-only version** of PyTorch as an alternative. Follow those instructions if the GPU install fails and you cannot resolve the underlying GPU/driver issue.
4.  **Prepare Additional Local Models (Optional):**
    *   Inside the extracted project folder (e.g., `PerchanceRevival`), create a directory named `checkpoints` (if `setup.bat` didn't create it).
    *   Place any *additional* Stable Diffusion 1.5 models (in `diffusers` format ‚Äì a folder containing files like `model_index.json`, `unet/`, `vae/`, etc.) that you want to use *beyond* the featured Perchance models inside the `checkpoints` directory. The app will detect and list these alongside the default options.
        Example structure:
        ```
        PerchanceRevival/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ checkpoints/          <-- For YOUR additional models
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-custom-model/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model_index.json
        ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unet/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ another-local-model/
        ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              <-- Main application script
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     <-- Dependency list
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.bat            <-- Easy setup script
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.bat              <-- Easy run script
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ update.bat           <-- Easy update script
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/              <-- Folder containing example image
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ciphercore01.png <-- Example screenshot image file
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                  <-- Other app files
        ```

## üîÑ Updating the Application (Windows - Easy Method)

To get the latest code and dependency updates from this repository after using the easy setup:

*   Navigate to the project folder (e.g., `PerchanceRevival`).
*   Find the file named `update.bat`.
*   **Double-click `update.bat`** to run it.
*   A command prompt window will open and pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository and upgrade the Python packages in your virtual environment according to `requirements.txt`. It will **not** attempt to change your PyTorch installation (GPU vs CPU) unless specifically updated in `requirements.txt`.
*   **Important:** This assumes you have not made local changes that conflict with the repository updates. If `git pull` fails, you may need to handle merge conflicts manually or discard local changes.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application (Windows - Easy Method)

Once the setup is complete (including successful PyTorch installation, whether GPU or CPU), launch the Gradio web UI by double-clicking the `run.bat` file in your project folder (e.g., `PerchanceRevival`).

*   A command prompt window will open, activate the environment, and start the application.
*   A browser window should automatically open to the application (or a local URL will be provided in the console, usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).
